Hi!! This is
# the self in the mirror the mirror in the self

a narrative text-based experience that is both a tribute and a criticism of the classic personality quiz.
This was made for Project 2: Sense of Self in DES INV 23 in Spring 2026.

## To use:

1. git clone this repo

2. Install requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
   (recommended: run source venv/bin/activate to open a virtual environment instead of installing it directly onto your system!)
### 3. Running the program

3a. Open terminal if not already open<br>
3b. Start local host using python3 -m http.server<br>
    Something like this sound appear in your terminal:<br>
    Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/) ... <br>
3c. Open a tab in your browser <br>
3d. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/templates/mirror.html (or whatever local host your system is using)
3e. Click on the mirror to begin the experience

## Thank you for visiting! This is my very first game that I fully planned, wrote, and implemented on my own! I am quite proud of it and I hope that this is the first of many :)
